# space-tourism

## What is it?
[Space Tourism](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel) is a collaboration brought to you by [Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) and [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/).

## How'd you do it?
I am building it with regular ole HTML, CSS, and üç¶ Javascript.

## Why?
I mostly use React in my job, but I want to build up my fundamental web skills.  I'm interested in learning a more organized approach to CSS and  building my knoweldge about web accessibility.

## Can I see it?
Sure! You can check out the work in progress [here](https://leahwho.github.io/space-tourism/).
